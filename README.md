# Sentiment Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project involves building a machine learning pipeline to predict the sentiment (positive/negative) of text-based reviews. It was developed in a Jupyter Notebook as part of a data science learning initiative, focusing on natural language processing (NLP) and classification algorithms.

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project is to:

* Analyze and clean text data
* Convert raw text into numerical features
* Build and evaluate classification models to accurately predict the sentiment

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

## 📂 Dataset

* The dataset consists of textual reviews labeled with sentiments (positive or negative).

## ⚙️ Features & Workflow

### 1. **Text Preprocessing**

* Lowercasing
* Removing punctuation, stopwords, special characters
* Tokenization

### 2. **Feature Engineering**

* TF-IDF Vectorization

### 3. **Model Building**

* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Random Forest (optional ensemble model)

### 4. **Evaluation Metrics**

* Accuracy
* Precision, Recall, F1-Score
* Confusion Matrix

### 5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**

* GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance

## 📊 Results

* Achieved up to **70%+ accuracy** on test data with SVM and Logistic Regression
* Visualized confusion matrix and performance metrics to compare models

## 🔐 Limitations & Considerations

* Basic models might struggle with sarcasm or context-based sentiment
* Could be improved with deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)
